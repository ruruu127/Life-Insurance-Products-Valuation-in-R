## Lucy and Kevin's mortgage protection
Cynthia is now a full-fledged actuary, working for an actuarial consulting company in Belgium. Her friends, Lucy and Kevin, call for help. They are about to buy an apartment, and will sign up for a 25-year mortgage to finance this apartment. Lucy and Kevin want to buy a financial product that covers the outstanding balance on the mortgage in case one of them dies before the mortgage is settled. What kind of product do they need?

**Possible Answers:**

* A life annuity with a duration 25 years. (That can't be right! Recall that a life annuity pays out a series of payments conditional on the survival of the policyholder.)
* A pure endowment with maturity of 25 years. (Think again! Recall that a pure endownment with a maturity of 25 years pays out a lump sum in 25 years from now in case the policyholder is still alive at that time.)
* A life insurance with a duration 25 years and a constant death benefit. (Try again! The product is indeed a life insurance, but the benefit should depend on the outstanding balance of the mortgage and hence decreases over time.)
* **A life insurance with a duration 25 years and decreasing death benefit.**

Correct! A life insurance with a death benefit equal to the outstanding balance of the mortgage (and hence decreasing) is the right product for Lucy and Kevin.

## Take it easy: a simple life insurance

### Exercise
Cynthia wants to help her friend Ethan who is studying for the Long-Term Actuarial Mathematics exam organized by the Society of Actuaries. She explains him a very simple life insurance product: a product sold to $(20)$ that pays 10,000 EUR at the end of the year of death if death occurs at a given age $30$. The figure illustrates how you should value this life insurance coverage.

![](image/ch4-ex-1.png)

You can assume an interest rate $i=1%$ and use the one-year survival probabilities `px` and mortality rates `qx` which have been preloaded.

```{r echo=TRUE}
life_table <- read.csv2('data/life_table_females_1999.csv')
qx <- life_table$qx
px <- 1 - qx
```

### Instructions

* Define `kpx` as the 10-year survival probability of (20).
* Assign the 10-year deferred mortality probability of (20) to `kqx`.
* Specify the discount factor that discounts a payment at the end of year 11 to the present moment at rate 1%.
* Calculate the EPV of the simple life insurance product by multiplying the benefit of 10,000 EUR with `discount_factor` and `kqx`.

```{r echo=TRUE}
# 10-year survival probability of (20) 
kpx <- prod(px[(20+1):(29+1)])
kpx

# 10-year deferred mortality probability of (20) 
kqx <- kpx * qx[30+1]
kqx

# Discount factor
discount_factor <- (1 + 0.01) ^ - (11)
discount_factor

# EPV of the simple life insurance
10000 * discount_factor * kqx
```

Nice work! A life insurance over a longer period of time can be seen as a combination of these type of one-year contracts as you will learn in the next video.

## Life annuity vs life insurance
First a little warm-up! Which of these two figures shows the expected present value $A_x$ of a whole life insurance (with constant benefit of 1 EUR) for varying ages $x$ and interest rates $i$?

![](image/ch3-ex-R-1.png)

**Possible Answers:**

* Left figure (Try again! The figure on the left represents the EPV $\ddot{a}_x$  of a whole life annuity which pays out a series of 1 EUR payments conditional on the survival of the policyholder. These types of products you studied in the previous chapter.)
* **Right figure.**
* I have no clue. (Should the value of $A_x$ increase or decrease by $x$? Also consider the range of the y-axis.)

Nice one! The right figure shows how the EPV $A_x$ of a whole life insurance increases with the age $x$ as at higher ages it's more likely that the death benefit has to be paid out sooner. In addition, the EVP clearly decreases with the interest rate $i$ since a higher interest rate means that the insurer has to set less aside today to build up the future death benefit.

## Whole life insurance

### Exercise
To help out her friend Ethan who is studying for the actuarial exam, Cynthia wants to build him some R code that calculates the EPV of a (whole) life insurance on $(x)$ for a given constant interest rate $i$. Since the death benefits are constant at 1 EUR, you don't need to explicitly take them into account in the calculations.

![](image/ch4-vid2-2.png)

The 1999 Belgian female life table is preloaded as `life_table`. The functions `plot_by_age()` and `plot_by_interest_rate()` have been predefined to illustrate how the EPV varies with the age $x$ of the policyholder and with the interest rate. You can inspect these functions by typing their name in the R console.

```{r echo=TRUE}
plot_by_age <- function() {
  ages <- 0:100
  EPV <- sapply(ages, whole_life_insurance, i = 0.03, life_table = life_table)
  plot(ages, EPV,
       type = 'l',
       col = "red",
       ylim = c(0, 1),
       main = "Whole life insurance (interest rate i = 3%)",
       xlab = "Age x",
       ylab = "EPV")
}

plot_by_interest_rate <- function() {
  interest_rates <- seq(0.001, 0.10, by = 0.001)
  EPV <- sapply(interest_rates, whole_life_insurance, age = 20, life_table = life_table)
  plot(interest_rates, EPV,
       type = 'l',
       col = "red",
       ylim = c(0, 1),
       main = "Whole life insurance (age 20)",
       xlab = "Interest rate i",
       ylab = "EPV")
}
```

### Instructions

* Complete the function `whole_life_insurance()` which calculates the EPV of a whole life insurance for given `age`, interest rate `i` and `life_table`.
* Run the predefined code to plot the EPV of a whole life insurance for a range of ages (at interest rate 3%) and a range of interest rates (for a 20-year-old). Interpret the resulting graphs.

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Function to compute the EPV of a whole life insurance
whole_life_insurance <- function(age, i, life_table) {
  qx <- life_table$qx
  px <- 1 - qx
  kpx <- c(1, cumprod(px[(age + 1):(length(px) - 1)]))
  kqx <- kpx * qx[(age + 1):length(qx)]
  discount_factors <- (1 + i) ^ - (1:length(kqx))
  sum(discount_factors * kqx)
}

# Plot the EPV of a whole life insurance for a range of ages at interest rate 3% using life_table
plot_by_age()

# Plot the EPV of a whole life insurance for (20) for a range of interest rates using life_table
plot_by_interest_rate()
```

Awesome! For a fixed interest rate, the EPV of a whole life insurance goes up with the age as the remaining lifetime of the insured becomes shorter and therefore the death benefit will have to be paid out sooner. For a fixed age, the EPV of the whole life insurance goes down when the interest rate increases as money grows faster and therefore the discount factors are smaller.

## Temporary life insurance

### Exercise
Ethan wonders how the EPV of a life insurance changes in case the coverage is restricted in time, as shown in the figure below.

![](image/ch4-vid2-3.png)

He first calculates the EPV of a whole life insurance for a 20-year-old at an interest rate $i=2%$ and using the preloaded `life_table` for females in Belgium in 1999.

Starting from the function `whole_life_insurance()` created in the previous exercise, can you assist Cynthia in writing a function for a temporary life insurance?

### Instructions

* Define the function `temporary_life_insurance()` which computes the EPV for a temporary life insurance. Besides the recurring arguments `age`, `i` and `life_table`, the function now takes an additional argument `n` indicating the number of years the life insurance coverage holds.
* Use your newly defined `temporary_life_insurance()` function to calculate how the EPV of the life insurance of (20) at rate 2% changes when the coverage is restricted to a period of 45 years.

```{r echo=TRUE}
# EPV of a whole life insurance for (20) at interest rate 2% using life_table
whole_life_insurance(20, 0.02, life_table)

# Function to compute the EPV of a temporary life insurance
temporary_life_insurance <- function(age, n, i, life_table) {
  qx <- life_table$qx
  px <- 1 - qx
  kpx <- c(1, cumprod(px[(age + 1):(age + n - 1)]))
  kqx <- kpx * qx[(age + 1):(age + n)]
  discount_factors <- (1 + i) ^ - (1:length(kqx))
  sum(kqx * discount_factors)
}

# EPV of a temporary life insurance for (20) over a period of 45 years at interest rate 2% using life_table
temporary_life_insurance(20, 45, 0.02, life_table)
```

Perfect! In this setting, the EPV of the life insurance for (20) becomes almost 6 times smaller when we restrict the coverage over a period of 45 years.

## Deferred life insurance

### Exercise
Cynthia now challenges Ethan to change the code himself to calcualte the EPV of a deferred life insurance on $(x)$ for a given contant interest rate $i$. The following figure shows the corresponding timeline for a deferral period of $u$ years.

![](image/ch4-vid2-4.png)

There is no death benefit if the policyholder dies during the first $u$ years. From time $u$ on, a death benefit of 1 EUR is payable at the end of the year of death of the policyholder.

The function `whole_life_insurance()` and the EPV of a whole life insurance for a 20-year-old at interest rate $i = 2%$ and using the 1999 female `life_table` are given as a starting point.

### Instructions

* Specify the `deferred_life_insurance()` function which computes the EPV of a deferred life insurance for a given `age`, deferral period `u`, interest rate `i` and `life table`.
* Apply the `deferred_life_insurance()` function to compute the EPV of a life insurance with a deferral period of 45 years. Use age 20, interest rate 2% and the preloaded 1999 female `life_table`.

```{r echo=TRUE}
# EPV of a whole life insurance for (20) at interest rate 2% using life_table
whole_life_insurance(20, 0.02, life_table)

# Function to compute the EPV of a deferred whole life insurance
deferred_life_insurance <- function(age, u, i, life_table) {
  qx <- life_table$qx;  px <- 1 - qx
  kpx <- c(1, cumprod(px[(age + 1):(length(px) - 1)]))
  kqx <- kpx * qx[(age + 1):length(qx)]
  discount_factors <- (1 + i) ^ - (1:length(kqx))
  benefits <- c(rep(0, u), rep(1, length(kpx) - u))
  sum(benefits * discount_factors * kqx)
}

# EPV of a deferred life insurance for (20) deferred over 45 years at interest rate 2% using life_table
deferred_life_insurance(20, 45, 0.02, life_table)
```

Well done! It should be no surprise that the EPV is lower for the deferred life insurance compared to the whole life insurance.

## A life insurance plan for Miss Cathleen

### Exercise
Cynthia helped Miss Cathleen while she was an intern with a life insurance company. Now, Miss Cathleen, aged 48, seeks for financial protection in case she would die around her retirement. To protect her growing-up children she wants to insure a benefit of 40,000 EUR for death between age 55 and 75, as shown below.

![](image/ch4-ex-2.png)

To value this temporary life insurance plan you will once again use the 1999 Belgian female life table, of which the one-year survival probabilities `px` and mortality rates `qx` have been preloaded. The assumed interest rate of 5% is available as `i`.

### Instructions

* Calculate the deferred mortality probabilities $q_{48}, _{1|}q_{48},...,_{26|}q_{48}$ of a 48-year-old up to age 75 as the product of multi-year survival probabilities and mortality rates.
* Define the appropriate discount factors at rate `i`.
* Specify the `benefits` vector as the death benefits of this temporary life insurance.
* Compute the expected present value of the plan.

```{r echo=TRUE}
i <- 0.05

# Deferred mortality probabilites of (48)
kqx <- c(1, cumprod(px[(48 + 1):(73 + 1)])) * qx[(48 + 1):(74+1)]

# Discount factors
discount_factors <- (1 + i) ^ - (1:length(kqx))

# Death benefits
benefits <- c(rep(0, 7), rep(40000, length(kqx) - 7))

# EPV of the death benefits                      
EPV_death_benefits <- sum(benefits * discount_factors * kqx)
EPV_death_benefits
```

Good job! In the final exercise you will extend Miss Cathleen's insurance plan with a savings component.

## Best of both worlds - the endowment insurance

### Exercise
Cynthia knows Miss Cathleen’s family and their financial situation quite well. Cynthia suggests her to think about retirement home expenses and to add a savings component to her policy that pays 80,000 EUR if she is alive at age 75. Miss Cathleen wants to finance this endowment insurance using constant premiums $P$. The full setup of the life insurance plan is visualized in the following timeline.

![](image/ch4-ex-3.png)

The survival probabilities `px`, the interest rate `i` and `EPV_death_benefits`, which you computed in the previous exercise, are available in your workspace. Now it is up to you to determine the premium level $P$.

### Instructions

* Determine the EPV of the pure endowment by multiplying the benefit of 80,000, the discount factor $(1+i)^{-27}$ and the survival probability $_{27}p_{48}$.
* Calculate the EPV of the premium pattern and assign the result to `EPV_rho`.
* Print the premium level $P$ using the concept of actuarial equivalence.

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Pure endowment
EPV_pure_endowment <- 80000 * (1 + i) ^  - 27 * prod(px[(48+1):(74+1)])
EPV_pure_endowment

# Premium pattern
kpx <- c(1, cumprod(px[(48+ 1):(73+1)]))
discount_factors <- (1 + i) ^ - (0:(length(kpx) - 1)) 
rho <- rep(1, length(kpx))
EPV_rho <- sum(rho * discount_factors * kpx)
EPV_rho

# Premium level
(EPV_death_benefits + EPV_pure_endowment) / EPV_rho
```

Impressive work!
