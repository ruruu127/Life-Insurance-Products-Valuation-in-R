Understanding the basic principles of life insurance products is essential for your personal financial planning, ranging from taking out a mortgage to designing your retirement plan and seeking financial protection for the risk of dying early. In this course, you'll study the time value of money and youâ€™ll work with human mortality data to derive demographic markers (such as the life expectancy). Combining the basics of cash flow valuation with the calculation of survival and death probabilities in R will allow you to construct insightful tools to design life insurance products. You'll come out of this course understanding the valuation of life contingent claims: life annuities, which provide an income upon survival, and life insurance products, which pay a benefit upon death of the policyholder.
